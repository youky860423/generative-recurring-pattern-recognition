function lambdamax = tvdiplmax(y)
% Calculate the value of lambda so that if lambda >= lambdamax, the TVD
% functional solved by TVDIP is minimized by the trivial constant
% solution x = mean(y). This can then be used to determine a useful range
% of values of lambda, for example.
%
% Usage:
% lambdamax = tvdiplmax(y)
%
% Input arguments:
% - y          Original signal to denoise, size N x 1.
%
% Output arguments:
% - lambdamax  Value of at which x = mean(y) is the output of the TVDIP
%              function.
